1. Introduction
Good morning all, I expect most of you reading this article will be like me, super anxious to get into one of Canada's best Engineering universities. 
As a student throughout elementary, middle, and highschool I was never the best or even close to being the best in academics, athletics or in terms of other extra-curriculars. As you may know Waterloo looks for the very best in academics and extracurriculars (maybe not so much in terms of athletics). I expect that many of you reading this may be seeking insight and tips into what you can do to improve your chances at admissions to the university of Waterloo. They offer one of the best Engineering, social work/psychology, and kinesiology programs in the country. This is obviously no fluke. Waterloo ensures you as a student are prepared both academically for possibly grad school and with the right real world skills for a job in industry. They accomplish this through intensive academics and a strong co-operative education program.
2. What did I do differently?
In grade 8 I remember thinking clearly " man school is boring, you only learn so much in class and I always end up with so much time to kill afterwards." This intense boredom pushed me to find as many sports teams and clubs to join as I could. I ended up joining these clubs and teams in grade 8:
- ‎Cross country
- ‎Track & field
- ‎Badminton
- ‎Soccer
- ‎Student Council
Satisfied with all the less time in my hands I applied for academic programs in highschool. MACS @ McKenzie CI & HMST @ Northview Heights SS I was rejected from the first, and naturally I went to Northview for their HMST program.
To sum up my years at Northview I did the following things:
- ‎participate in math, science and computer science competitions
- ‎become the executive of the following clubs
- ‎Business Club
- ‎DECA
- ‎Leadership Club
- ‎FIRST Robotics
- ‎SHSM ICT (Specialist High Skills Major in Information Communication Technology)
- ‎I also participated in the following sports
- ‎Swim Team
- ‎Cross Country
- ‎Water Polo
- ‎Track & Field
- ‎Badminton
- ‎And I completed a coop in grade 12 at York University
I did also participate in a few other clubs outside of school like Junior Achievement, but that's not too important.
Now that I have plenty of things to potentially talk about since I've been a part of them I can now proceed to writing the essay section of the AIF(Waterloo's supplementary application called the Application Information Form). This form is really full of questions for you to brag about all your achievements and your aspirations. You literally have pages and pages to write about why you are a person that doesn't exist solely for marks why you are a person that will do more that just the 9 to 5 clock and and clock out. This is the time you've been waiting for (you can tell I'm excited).
