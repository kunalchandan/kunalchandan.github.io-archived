								<p>A short bio on who we are</p>
								<h2>The Brothers Chandan</h2>
							</header>
							<p>My brother and co-founder Uday is an aspiring Biomedical Engineer, he has designed  many complex mechanical and electrical systems at home to solve small problems, and sometimes during his rare spare time he will draw awesome works of art with pens, pencils, paints and whatever else he can get his hands on.</p>

							<p>I am Kunal the younger brother of Uday, I don't know exactly where I'm headed in life, but I know I'm not going to settle for mediocrity. I love taking part in every aspect of school, sports teams, clubs, retreats and councils of all sorts. In my spare time I enjoy learning math, programming, and biology.</p>

								<p>Tell us about a time when you started something from scratch (a business, a project, a program, etc.) and one impressive achievement you are proud of from this experience.</p>
								<h2>Past Experience</h2>
							</header>
							<p>My brother-in-law and I once started a subscription based food delivery company that served students at York University. We started with $30 in capital and by the end of 4 months we had earned over $4000. Although we earned money, it was more of a learning experience than something to brag about.</p>
							<p>Our business started by first advertising with flyers that we designed ourselves, and Kijiji advertisements. From this I learned what kinds of things attract people, and a little bit of SEO where learning to use good keywords attracted significantly more customers.</p>
							<p>Then once we moved onto managing orders we began to learn more about modularization and scalability. Our first mistakes with large orders taught us that dividing individual tasks to separate people is essential to increasing efficiency, and reducing time wastage. We also learned about designing for scalability, because we were using text messages to keep track of and manage orders, mistakes were possible, and very easy to make.</p>
							<p>In the end we learned from our mistakes, and became smarter than we were before our venture, and wee gained many insights into how best to move forward if we ever tried something like that again.</p>

							<header class="align-center">
								<p>Briefly tell us about one transformative past failure.</p>
								<h2>Failure</h2>
							</header>
							<p>One of the biggest transformative failures I've had was all due to my inattention, underpreparedness and egocentricity. I had applied for a paid hospital internship at the LTRI of the University of Toronto, this was something I was only moderately interested in, and even that only for the money. Other students interested in health sciences from my school had also applied however they never heard back. I became one of 15 people selected for ten positions, at this I began to feed my ego, and disregarded preparation for the interview, due to this I was rejected.</p>
							<p>This rejection opened my eyes, and I began to search elsewhere for an internship, unpaid of course, I had lost the opportunity. The search consumed me, and I began speaking to professors at York University for an internship, and I found one with Dr.Elder.</p>

							<header class="align-center">
								<p>Why do you want to be part of the YEDI program?</p>
								<h2>Why YEDI?</h2>
							</header>
							<p>I want to be part of the YEDI program because I've always had burning desire to leave an impact on the world around me, and I believe that YEDI will be able to provide me with the appropriate mentorship and education to help me launch a successful startup.</p>
							<p>I want to use the networks available to help me with the technical aspects of designing ideal materials, and implementing them onto a replicable design. To start off I want to establish the foundatons of the company, including potential patents, establishing a legal base and completely understand all technical challenges I need to overcome to reach completion. By the end of the session I want to have a working prototype that is able to compete with current food 3D printers in technical ability.</p>

							<header class="align-center">
								<p>Briefly, what experience/expertise do you have relevant to your venture's industry?</p>
								<h2>Expertise</h2>
							</header>
							<p>I am currently the Build head of the FIRST robotics team in my school, and I lead the design and production of all electrical and mechanical components of our team's robot. I also founded the programming team at our school, and led our team to semi-provincials last year for a team programming competition. </p>
							<p>Not only does my interest extend within school, it wraps around every aspect of my life. I hold an internship in computer vision with Dr. James Elder that I acquired myself, and use as my coop placement at school.</p>
							<p>All of these things together are just a small part of my entire life experience, and have given me a firm understanding of engineering, and programming, the two most key aspects of the venture I hope to pursue.</p>
